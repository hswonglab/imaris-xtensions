This script contains functions to enable batch operation of XTensions. To use,
import the XTBatch function into the script implementing your XTension. Then
call XTBatch with a function implementing your XTension as an argument.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vImarisApplication : IApplication
        Imaris application object currently connected
    fn : Callable[ [IDataset, *args], IDataset ] or Callable[ [IApplication, *args], None ]
        function to apply to each file
        see documentation for operate_on_images for more information on input and output types
    args : tuple(...) (optional)
        tuple of variables to be passed to fn as arguments
    im_args_dict : dict[str:tuple(...)] (optional)
        Arguments to `fn` that should override the default arguments in `args`
        for a particular image, expressed as a mapping from image path
        (excluding the `.ims` extension) to the arguments (as a tuple) that
        should be used instead of `args` for that image.
    operate_on_image : bool 
        If True, fn should operate directly on the image (IDataset object).
        XTBatch will expect a new image to be returned by each call to fn,
        replace the existing image with it, then save the file with the new
        image.
        If False, fn will have direct access to the IApplication object, which
        can operate on both the image and the associated surpass object.
        XTBatch will expect fn to interact directly with the IApplication
        object, and save the state of the file after fn is applied
