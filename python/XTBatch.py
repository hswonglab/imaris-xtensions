    ----------
    vImarisApplication : IApplication
        Imaris application object currently connected
    fn : Callable[ [IDataset, *args], IDataset ] or Callable[ [IApplication, *args], None ]
        function to apply to each file
        see documentation for operate_on_images for more information on input and output types
    args : tuple(...) (optional)
        tuple of variables to be passed to fn as arguments
    im_args_dict : dict[str:tuple(...)] (optional)
        use this argument if any arguments of fn are specific to each image
        dictionary with image names as keys and image-specific arguments as values  
        the keys must match the full file names of the .ims files (without the extension) to be applied correctly
        the values must be packed in a tuple since it will be unpacked before being passed to fn
    operate_on_image : bool 
        if True, fn should operate directly on the image (IDataset object) 
            XTBatch will expect a new image to be returned by each call to fn, replace the existing image with it, then save the file with the new image
        if False, fn will have direct access to the IApplication object, which can operate on both the image and the associated surpass objects  
            XTBatch will expect fn to interact directly with the IApplication object, and save the state of the file after fn is applied
